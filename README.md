A collection of JSNAP tests I have used over the time.

JSNAP may be a dead product but it is really good (for the most part) at quick automated tests that need little to no programing skills.

#### /master.conf
A single conf file of all tests used.

#### /get_snapshots.sh
Script to collect tests against a list of devices.

#### /compare_snapshots.sh
Script to compare results against a list of devices.

#### /routers.txt
List of routers and switches used in the scripts.
